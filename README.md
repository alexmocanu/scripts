# Some scripts I use from time to time

##### 1. alpine-setup-mate.sh

A quick script I use to quickly setup a MATE Desktop on an Alpine Linux machine. 

Requirements:
- must be run as root
- assumes a "sys" installation with all repositories enabled: (main, community, testing, stable, edge)

To set the username and password for the restricted user change the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables at the top.
Use at your own risk.

##### 2. alpine-setup-xfce.sh

A quick script I use to quickly setup a XFCE Desktop on an Alpine Linux machine. 

Requirements:
- must be run as root
- assumes a "sys" installation with all repositories enabled: (main, community, testing, stable, edge)

To set the username and password for the restricted user change the USERNAME and PASSWORD variables at the top.
Use at your own risk.
